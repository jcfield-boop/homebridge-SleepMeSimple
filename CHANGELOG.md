## 6.12.3 (2025-01-07)

### Priority Assignment Refactoring
- **Context-Aware Priority System**: Replaced simple boolean flags with intelligent request prioritization
  - Added `RequestContext` interface to enable context-aware priority determination
  - Background polling for inactive devices now uses LOW priority instead of inappropriate HIGH priority
  - Active device polling uses NORMAL priority for better responsiveness without bypassing rate limits
  - Discovery operations now use LOW priority to avoid competing with user actions
  - Startup operations distinguish between user-triggered (HIGH) vs system-initiated (LOW) requests
- **Fixed Rate Limiting Issues**: Eliminated 429 errors during background polling with proper priority assignment
  - Aggressive polling was inappropriately using HIGH priority, bypassing rate limit protections
  - Background operations now respect rate limits while maintaining responsive user interactions
  - Context-aware system considers request source, urgency, device state, and operation type

### Technical Implementation
- **New RequestContext Interface**: Provides structured context for intelligent priority determination
  - `source`: 'user' | 'polling' | 'startup' | 'discovery' | 'system'
  - `urgency`: 'immediate' | 'routine' | 'background' | 'maintenance'
  - `deviceActive`: Boolean indicating if device is actively heating/cooling
  - `userTriggered`: Boolean indicating user-initiated vs system-initiated operations
  - `operation`: 'status' | 'control' | 'discovery' | 'validation'
- **Enhanced determinePriority() Method**: Context-aware logic replaces simple forceFresh boolean
  - User control actions remain CRITICAL priority for immediate responsiveness
  - User status requests use HIGH priority for immediate feedback
  - Active device routine polling gets NORMAL priority for good responsiveness
  - Background polling for inactive devices uses LOW priority
  - Discovery operations default to LOW priority unless user-triggered
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API signatures while adding context-aware variants
  - `getDeviceStatus()` accepts both new RequestContext and legacy boolean parameters
  - All existing call sites updated to use appropriate context objects
  - No breaking changes to public API interface

### Benefits
- üõ°Ô∏è **Eliminated Rate Limiting**: Background polling no longer inappropriately bypasses rate limits
- üéØ **Smarter Prioritization**: Context-aware system assigns priorities based on actual request importance
- ‚ö° **Maintained Responsiveness**: User interactions remain immediate while background operations respect limits
- üîÑ **Better Resource Usage**: API capacity allocated appropriately based on request context
- üìä **Consistent Behavior**: Eliminates unpredictable rate limiting from background operations

## 6.12.2 (2025-01-07)

### Performance Improvements
- **Aggressive polling for active devices**: Active devices (heating/cooling) now poll every 15 seconds instead of 3 minutes
  - Perfect API utilization: 15s interval matches 4 requests/minute rate limit exactly
  - Dramatically improved responsiveness for temperature monitoring and user interactions
  - Inactive devices continue efficient 2-minute polling to preserve API capacity
- **Smart user interaction joining**: User actions intelligently coordinate with scheduled polls
  - If scheduled poll is within 3 seconds, user action waits to "join" rather than duplicate
  - If poll is far away, triggers immediate poll and resets timer
  - Eliminates redundant API calls while maintaining immediate responsiveness
- **Dual polling system**: Separate optimized timers for active vs inactive devices
  - Active device timer: 15-second aggressive polling for real-time updates
  - Normal device timer: 2-minute standard polling for external change detection
  - Automatic switching based on device thermal status (active/heating/cooling vs standby/off)

### Technical Details
- Added `ACTIVE_DEVICE_POLL_INTERVAL` (15s) and poll timing coordination maps
- Enhanced `triggerDevicePollIfNeeded()` with smart joining logic (3s threshold)
- Implemented `pollActiveDevices()` and `pollSingleActiveDevice()` methods
- Updated accessory to use smart poll coordination after user actions
- Rate limiting protection via API client's existing priority system

### Benefits

## 6.11.14 (2025-01-07)

### Critical Rate Limiting Fix - Startup Collision ‚ö°
**Fixed 429 rate limit errors during startup caused by overlapping API requests.**

### Rate Limiting Fix
- **Startup Request Collision Fixed**: Initial status fetch and first polling cycle were colliding
  - Both requests fired within 1-2 seconds causing immediate 429 errors
  - Increased polling delay from 1s to 5s after discovery to prevent overlap
  - Ensures initial device status completes before polling begins
- **Cleaner Startup Sequence**: Eliminates race condition between initial fetch and polling

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: `req_1` (initial status) and `req_2` (poll cycle 1) fired simultaneously
- **Solution**: Delayed first poll cycle to 5 seconds after device discovery
- **Impact**: No more startup 429 errors and token bucket sync issues

### Benefits
- üö´ **No More 429 Errors**: Clean startup without rate limiting collisions
- ‚ö° **Stable Token Management**: Proper spacing between API requests
- üîÑ **Reliable Initialization**: Initial status always completes before polling starts

**Result**: Startup now works reliably without hitting rate limits on the very first requests!

## 6.11.13 (2025-01-07)

### Smart Initialization Fix - Target Temperature Reset üéØ
**Fixed target temperature initialization to always use current temperature at reboot for safer startup behavior.**

### Temperature Initialization
- **Safe Reboot Behavior**: Target temperature always set to current temperature on Homebridge restart
  - Prevents unwanted heating/cooling when system starts up
  - Target temperature no longer persists from previous sessions
  - Example: If room is 20.5¬∞C at startup, target is set to 20.5¬∞C (not previous 26¬∞C setting)
- **Clear Startup Intent**: Neutral temperature state until user explicitly sets desired temperature
- **Improved Logging**: "Reboot initialization" messages clearly indicate startup behavior

### Benefits
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Startup**: No surprise heating/cooling when Homebridge restarts
- üéØ **Predictable Behavior**: Target always matches current temperature initially
- üîÑ **Clean State**: Each restart begins with neutral temperature setting
- üìù **Clear Logging**: Obvious distinction between reboot vs runtime behavior

### Runtime Behavior Unchanged
- External app temperature changes still respected during normal operation
- Long inactivity periods still reset target to current temperature
- All other defensive improvements from 6.11.12 remain active

**Result**: Much safer and more predictable startup behavior - no unexpected temperature changes when restarting Homebridge!

## 6.11.12 (2025-01-07)

  - Tracks API temperature changes that weren't initiated by HomeKit
  - Logs friendly "External control detected" messages instead of alarming warnings
  - Prevents smart initialization from overriding legitimate external temperature changes
- **Defensive Smart Temperature Logic**: More conservative initialization prevents conflicts
  - Only applies temperature overrides during true startup or after 5+ minutes of inactivity (vs 1 minute)
  - Completely skips smart initialization when recent external app activity detected
  - Respects external temperature settings from native app and schedules
- **Faster External Detection**: Reduced quiet period from 30s to 15s for quicker external change recognition

### Technical Improvements
- **External Activity Tracking**: New variables track external changes and timing
  - `lastKnownTargetTemp`: Monitors API temperature changes
  - `externalChangeDetected`: Flags recent external activity
  - `isFirstStatusUpdate`: Distinguishes startup from external changes
- **Improved Logging**: Clear distinction between HomeKit vs native app control
  - "üîÑ External control detected" for native app changes
  - "‚ö° HomeKit control" for HomeKit-initiated changes
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused debounce constant

### Benefits
- ü§ù **Seamless Dual Control**: Use both HomeKit and native SleepMe app without conflicts
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defensive Behavior**: Smart initialization won't interfere with external settings

## 6.12.0-beta.8 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Fixed Power Switch Sync Logic
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed Power Switch Sync Logic**: Temperature dial now properly detects and updates power switch state
  - Previous logic used internal device state which was unreliable
  - Now checks actual HomeKit power switch characteristic value
  - Should finally enable true one-step temperature setting (dial ‚Üí both auto & power switch on)

- **Fixed HomeKit Temperature Validation Errors**: Eliminated invalid temperature value warnings
  - Added proper bounds checking to prevent values below HomeKit minimums
  - Current temperature readings now respect MIN_TEMPERATURE_C limits
  - Target temperature defaults now use valid ranges

### Debug Information
- Previous logs showed "Auto-switching to AUTO mode" working (thermostat side)
- But power switch sync wasn't triggering due to incorrect state checking
- Firmware version issue: API returning `undefined` instead of version string

### Technical Details
- Changed from checking `!this.isPowered` to checking actual HomeKit characteristic value
- This ensures power switch sync works regardless of internal state confusion
- Added Math.max() guards to prevent HomeKit validation errors on temperature values

## 6.12.0-beta.7 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Temperature Dial & Firmware Debug Fixes
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### User Experience Fixes
- **Fixed Temperature Dial Power Sync**: Temperature changes now properly update both thermostat AND power switch
  - In hybrid mode, changing temperature on the dial now automatically turns on the power switch too
  - No longer need to manually switch Off‚ÜíAuto then set temperature
  - Both the thermostat state (Auto) and power switch (On) update simultaneously
  - Provides true one-step temperature setting experience

### Debug Improvements  
- **Added Firmware Version Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging to diagnose firmware display issues
  - Will show API vs Current firmware versions in debug logs
  - Helps identify if firmware version is being received from API but not updating display
  - Added detailed logging for firmware update process

### Technical Details
- The issue was that hybrid mode has separate services (Power Switch + Thermostat)
- Temperature changes were only updating the thermostat service's heating/cooling state
- Power switch service wasn't being updated, so users had to manually switch it
- Now both services update in sync for seamless user experience

### Testing Focus
- Verify temperature dial changes automatically turn on power switch in hybrid mode
- Check debug logs for firmware version comparison (if issue persists)
- Confirm both thermostat Auto state and power switch On state update together

## 6.12.0-beta.6 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Restore Empirical Rate Limits + Server Sync Fix
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### Major Fixes
- **Restored Empirically-Tested Rate Limits**: Reverted from overly conservative to proven working values
  - Token bucket: 2‚Üí7 tokens max (empirically tested burst capacity)
  - Refill rate: 60s‚Üí15s per token (4 requests/minute sustainable vs 1/minute)
  - Start with 3 tokens instead of 0 (conservative but not empty)
  - Based on actual testing rather than panic-induced over-conservation

- **Server Synchronization Fix**: Fixed client/server token bucket sync issues causing immediate 429s
  - Added `syncToServerEmpty()` method to align client bucket with server state
  - When 429 occurs, sync our bucket to match server's empty state
  - Should eliminate most "impossible" 429 errors on first requests

- **Reasonable Delays Restored**: 
  - Startup delay: 5 minutes‚Üí1 minute (reasonable vs excessive)
  - Polling interval: 15 minutes‚Üí5 minutes (conservative but usable)
  - Based on actual empirical testing limits rather than fear

### Technical Details
- The issue wasn't that we needed to be more conservative than documented limits
- Client-side token bucket was out of sync with server's actual state
- Server bucket was already empty when client thought it had tokens available
- Now properly syncs buckets on 429 errors to prevent future misalignment

### Benefits
- Much more responsive background updates (5 minute vs 15 minute polling)
- Faster startup (1 minute vs 5 minute delay)
- User commands should face much less waiting (4x more token capacity)
- Smarter rate limiting based on actual API behavior rather than guesswork

### Testing Focus
- Verify 429 errors are significantly reduced or eliminated
- Confirm faster polling and startup times work reliably
- Check that server sync prevents cascading 429 failures
- Ensure user commands are much more responsive

## 6.12.0-beta.5 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Critical UX & Rate Limiting Fixes
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### Critical Fixes
- **Improved Thermostat UX**: Temperature changes now automatically switch device to AUTO mode
  - Users can now simply adjust temperature dial and device turns on automatically
  - No longer need to manually switch Off‚ÜíAuto‚ÜíTemperature
  - Still respects 10-second cooldown if device was recently turned off
  - Much more intuitive user experience

- **Extreme Rate Limiting**: Addressed severe API rate limiting that was causing immediate 429 errors
  - Reduced token bucket from 3‚Üí2 tokens maximum capacity
  - Increased token refill from 30s‚Üí60s per token (1 request per minute sustainable)
  - Start with 0 tokens instead of any initial burst to avoid startup 429s
  - Increased startup delay from 3‚Üí5 minutes after Homebridge launch
  - Increased default polling from 10‚Üí15 minutes for maximum safety

### Technical Details
- SleepMe API is rejecting even CRITICAL priority user commands with immediate 429 errors
- This extreme conservation approach should finally work around the severe API enforcement
- User commands still get priority but must wait for token availability
- Background polling heavily throttled to preserve capacity for user actions

### Breaking Changes  
- Much slower background updates (15 minute polling vs 10 minutes)
- 5 minute delay before first API calls after startup
- Some user commands may need to wait up to 60 seconds if token bucket is empty

### Testing Focus
- Verify temperature dial changes automatically turn device to AUTO mode
- Confirm no immediate 429 errors on any operations
- Test that user commands eventually succeed (may be delayed)
- Ensure extreme rate limiting doesn't break core functionality

## 6.12.0-beta.4 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - HomeKit Interface Simplification
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### User Experience Improvements
- **Simplified HomeKit Interface**: Fixed hybrid interface to show only Off/Auto states instead of Off/Cool/Heat/Auto
  - Matches SleepMe device capabilities (single thermal mode with heating/cooling combined)
  - Eliminates confusing Heat/Cool options that don't apply to SleepMe devices
  - More intuitive user experience in HomeKit apps
  - Automatic switch to AUTO mode when setting target temperature (already working)

### Technical Details
- Applied the same `validValues` restriction from legacy thermostat interface to hybrid interface
- Only affects the HomeKit UI presentation, all functionality remains identical

## 6.12.0-beta.3 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Ultra-Conservative Rate Limiting Fix
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### Critical Fixes
- **Ultra-Conservative Rate Limiting**: Addressed immediate 429 errors on startup
  - Reduced token bucket from 7‚Üí3 tokens maximum capacity
  - Increased token refill interval from 15s‚Üí30s per token  
  - Start with only 1 token instead of full bucket to avoid burst issues
  - Increased cache validity from 8‚Üí30 minutes to reduce API dependency

- **Extended Startup Delays**: Added longer delays to prevent immediate API conflicts
  - Increased initial discovery delay from 1‚Üí3 minutes after Homebridge startup
  - Default polling interval increased from 5‚Üí10 minutes for safety
  - Much more conservative approach to handle stricter API enforcement

### Technical Details
- SleepMe API appears to have become more restrictive than previous empirical testing indicated
- Even with token bucket showing available capacity, API returns 429 errors immediately
- This release implements extreme conservation to work around the API issues
- User commands (power/temperature) still prioritized and can bypass some limits

### Breaking Changes
- Much slower background updates (10 minute polling vs 3 minutes)
- Longer cache periods may show stale data longer
- Slower multi-device initialization

### Testing Focus
- Verify no more immediate 429 errors on startup
- Check that polling eventually succeeds without rate limit errors
- Ensure user commands still work responsively despite conservative limits

## 6.12.0-beta.2 (2025-01-07)

### BETA Release - Startup Performance Improvements
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a beta release for testing. Please test thoroughly before using in production.**

### Performance Improvements
- **Removed API Startup Delay**: Eliminated 5-second artificial delay for immediate plugin responsiveness
  - API requests now execute immediately upon plugin startup
  - User commands no longer wait for arbitrary delay period
  - Token bucket system provides sufficient rate limiting protection

- **Faster Multi-Device Initialization**: Reduced device setup delays from 45s to 10s between devices
  - 3 devices now initialize in ~30 seconds vs ~2 minutes previously
  - 4x faster multi-device setup while still respecting API rate limits
  - Improved token bucket handles rate limiting more intelligently

### Technical Details
- Startup delays were originally added during rapid development when rate limiting was less understood
- Current sophisticated rate limiting (token bucket, priority queues, request deduplication) makes crude delays unnecessary
- CRITICAL priority requests (user commands) already bypassed delays anyway
- Background operations remain properly throttled by token bucket system

### Breaking Changes
- None - all functionality preserved, just faster execution

### Testing Focus
- Plugin startup responsiveness (should be immediate)
- Multi-device setup time (should be much faster)
- Rate limiting behavior (should be unchanged)
- User command execution (should be immediate from startup)
